# ICP Integration ‚Äì Webhash Deployment & Domain Management

This document outlines the implementation of Internet Computer (ICP) integration within **Webhash**, a no-code website builder that allows users to visually create, deploy, and manage websites ‚Äî without writing code or handling any infrastructure.

Webhash abstracts the complexities of canister lifecycle, asset upload, and domain mapping, enabling seamless decentralized publishing on ICP.

## üì¶ Deployment Architecture

Each website deployment creates or updates an ICP **canister** using `@dfinity/agent`, installs the necessary Wasm module, and uploads static assets.

### API: Create Deployment

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /deployments`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "userId": 123,
  "folderPath": "/path/to/project/assets",
  "deploymentId": 456
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Reuses an existing canister if `deploymentId` exists; otherwise, creates a new one.
- Installs the Wasm module onto the canister.
- Uploads all static files from the provided `folderPath`.
- Tracks deployment status (`IN_PROGRESS`, `FAILED`, `COMPLETED`) internally.
- Returns the assigned `canisterId`.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "canisterId": "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"
}
```

---

### Internal Flow

1. **Create or Fetch Canister:**  
   Via `icService.createCanister()` or lookup by `deploymentId`.

2. **Install Wasm Module:**  
   Uses `icService.installCode()` for new or upgrade deployments.

3. **Upload Files:**  
   Static files are uploaded as chunks using `icService.addAssets()`.

4. **Mark Status:**  
   Deployment status is stored with audit logs and timestamps.

## üîÑ Canister Cycle Monitoring

A background cron job monitors cycle usage across all deployed canisters:

- Runs periodically to fetch canister balances (`getCanisterStatus()`).
- If the balance falls below the threshold:
  - A top-up request is sent via `topUpCanister()`.
  - Cycle states are logged before and after the operation.
- Master wallet depletion triggers internal notifications and halts auto top-ups until replenished.

## üåê Custom Domain Integration

Webhash allows users to connect their own domains using **A records**. Instead of using ICP's native TXT/CNAME-based registration (which often fails for apex domains), Webhash uses a **gateway architecture** for broader compatibility and automated HTTPS.

We developed the gateway because many DNS providers do not support CNAME records at the apex (or top-level) domain (e.g., example.com). This limitation makes it difficult to directly point root domains to ICP-hosted websites using standard CNAME setups. The gateway solves this by allowing users to use A records instead.

## üßæ DNS Instructions

To link a custom domain:

1. Go to your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap, Cloudflare, GoDaddy).
2. Add an **A record**:

   - **Type:** A
   - **Host/Name:** `@` or `www`
   - **Value:** `<Webhash Gateway IP>`
   - **TTL:** Default (or lowest allowed)

3. Once DNS resolves:
   - The gateway verifies propagation
   - An SSL certificate is provisioned automatically
   - Your domain begins serving content via HTTPS from the ICP canister

---

## üß† Additional Notes

- Domain traffic is securely proxied from the Webhash Gateway to the assigned canister.
- SSL is handled automatically via ACME (no manual cert management).
- This approach ensures compatibility with both apex and subdomains.

## üìç Project Lifecycle States

| State         | Description                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Live`        | Site is deployed and running with cycles     |
| `LowBalance`  | Canister balance is low; top-up required     |
| `Deactivated` | Out of cycles; site is temporarily suspended |
| `Deleted`     | Manually removed by the user                 |
